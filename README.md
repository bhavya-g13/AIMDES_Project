Topic: Optimizing a mini-hybrid grid in rural Tanzania

Description: This project considers a hybrid mini-grid in a Tanzanian village. The mini-grid consists of a diesel
generator, PV panels, and a battery storage component. The primary objective of this project is to
analyze the existing hybrid mini-grid system, optimize its dispatch strategy from a cost-effectiveness
perspective, assess its sizing appropriateness, and evaluate the potential economic benefits of connecting the mini-grid to an external grid.
